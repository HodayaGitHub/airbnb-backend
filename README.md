## 1. Introduction
This repository contains the backend code for the Journey web application. It handles data storage, retrieval, and business logic for the platform.

## 2. Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose (ODM)

## 3. Setting Up MongoDB
Make sure you have MongoDB installed on your system. You can download it from [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community). 

Create a MongoDB database for Journey and update the connection string in the environment variables.

## 4. Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine:

```git clone https://github.com/your-username/journey-backend.git```

Navigate to the backend directory:
```cd journey-backend```

Install the required dependencies:
```npm install```

##5. Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root of the backend directory and set the following environment variables:

```dotenv```
```PORT=3001```
```MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string```
```SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_for_jwt```
```Replace your_mongodb_connection_string with your actual MongoDB connection string and set a secure SECRET_KEY for JWT token generation.```

##6. Running the Server
To start the backend server, run the following command:

npm start
The server will run on the port specified in the .env file (default is 3001).

##7. API Endpoints
Document the API endpoints and provide examples of how to use them. You can use tools like Swagger for API documentation.

Example:

```GET /api/users: Retrieve a list of all users.```
```POST /api/users: Create a new user.```

Make sure to replace placeholders like `your-username` and customize the information according to your project structure and requirements.
